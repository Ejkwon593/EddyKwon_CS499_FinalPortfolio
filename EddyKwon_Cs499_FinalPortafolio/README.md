README – Eddy Kwon CS 499 Final Portfolio



Student: Eddy Kwon

Course: CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone

Instructor: Dr. Bhandari

Date: October 2025



**Overview**



This folder contains my complete ePortfolio submission for the CS 499 Capstone course.

It includes all original and enhanced artifacts, narratives explaining the enhancements, the professional self-assessment, and the code review video.

The work demonstrates my progress and mastery of the Computer Science program outcomes in software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.



**Folder Contents**



1.Original\_Artifact/



Contains the original version of my C++ project: “Advising Assistance Program.”



This version uses a simple CSV file for course data.



2.Enhanced\_Artifact/



Contains the enhanced version of the project.



Enhancements include:



Object-oriented refactoring (class encapsulation and safer input handling)



Algorithmic improvements (topological sort and graph-based logic)



Database integration (SQLite support for persistent data storage)



2.Code Review/



Includes my recorded video presentation (MP4 file) explaining the original code structure, areas of improvement, and planned enhancements.

The code review is divided into two parts, providing a full walkthrough of the original artifact and planned enhancements.

- **[Part 1 – Code Review Overview](https://youtu.be/wL5vHgfwNPw)**  
  Covers the explanation of the original artifact, its structure, and the initial functionality before enhancements.

- **[Part 2 – Enhancement Plan and Analysis](https://youtu.be/NNv-yAj8FXY)**  
  Discusses areas for improvement, enhancement strategies, and alignment with the program outcomes.

These videos serve as the foundation for the enhancements in software design, algorithms, and databases demonstrated in this ePortfolio.



3.Enhancement1\_Narrative.docx



Describes the software design and engineering improvements made to the artifact.



4.Enhancement2\_Narrative.docx



Explains the enhancements related to algorithms and data structures.



5.Enhancement3\_Narrative.docx



Details the database enhancements, including integration with SQLite.



6.Professional\_SelfAssessment.docx



A reflective narrative summarizing my academic growth, technical skills, and professional readiness.



7.README.txt



This document, which provides a description of all included materials and the overall project structure.





**How to Run the Enhanced Project**



1\.Open the project in Visual Studio (or any C++ IDE).



2\.Ensure that the SQLite development files (sqlite3.c, sqlite3.h, and sqlite3.lib) are included in the project directory.



3\.Build and run the project.



4\.Use the on-screen menu to load the course data, view course lists, and display prerequisite information.



5\.The program will connect to or create a local SQLite database file automatically.





**Notes**



The code review video explains the relationship between the original and enhanced versions of the artifact.



The enhancements demonstrate mastery of all major CS program outcomes.
