Code Review Video – Eddy Kwon
-----------------------------------
This folder contains my official code review video for the CS-499 Capstone.

File included:
- EddyKwon_CodeReview.mp4

In this video, I demonstrate:
• The original C++ advising assistance program
• Its existing functionality
• Planned enhancements for software design, algorithms, and databases

This video satisfies the Code Review requirement for the CS-499 final project.

### 1. Code Review

The code review is divided into two parts, providing a full walkthrough of the original artifact and planned enhancements.

- **[Part 1 – Code Review Overview](https://youtu.be/wL5vHgfwNPw)**  
  Covers the explanation of the original artifact, its structure, and the initial functionality before enhancements.

- **[Part 2 – Enhancement Plan and Analysis](https://youtu.be/NNv-yAj8FXY)**  
  Discusses areas for improvement, enhancement strategies, and alignment with the program outcomes.

These videos serve as the foundation for the enhancements in software design, algorithms, and databases demonstrated in this ePortfolio.
